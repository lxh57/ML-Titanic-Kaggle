# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Kaggle ML Project
A machine learning model for solving the problem of predicting survivors

This project is a Machine Learning solution for the classic [Titanic Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), which predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on personal information.
